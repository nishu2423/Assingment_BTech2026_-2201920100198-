oops problem and solution (c++)

problem 1: (03-02-2025): Area of Rectangle

Problem statement
Design a class called Rectangle. It contains two data members as length(L) and breadth(B); and a member function getArea(). The member function computes the area of the given rectangle and returns it to the caller.

Note:

Area of a rectangle = length x breadth
Data Members:
1. length: Length of the rectangle
2. breadth: Breadth of the rectangle 
Member Functions:
1. getArea(): that calculates the area of the rectangle and returns the value.
Note:

You do not have to take input, just create the Class and set the name of the Data Members and function as given in the above discription.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
0 <= L, B <= 100
Sample Input 1:
4 20
Sample Output 1:
80
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
Length of the rectangle is 4 and breadth is 20. 
Hence the area of the rectangle is (length*breadth). 
So the answer is 4*20=80.
Sample Input 2:
2 10
Sample Output 2:
20
Explanation of Sample Input 2:
Length of the rectangle is 2 and breadth is 10. 
Hence the area of the rectangle is (length*breadth). 
So the answer is 2*10=20.



problem 2:(04-02-2025)  (Print Name and age)

Problem statement
Create a class named Person with a string variable 'name' and an integer variable 'age,' such that these variables are not accessible outside the class and implement a way to initialize the variables and print the variables.

Functions: 1.setValue- that sets the variables value. 2.getValue- that prints the variables value.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
Afzal
67
Sample Output 1:
The name of the person is Afzal and the age is 67.
Sample Input 2:
Ali
30
Sample Output 2:
The name of the person is Ali and the age is 30.
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
The input name is Ali and the input age is 30 which is printed in the specified format.

problem 3:(05-02-2025)  (Car Class)

Problem statement
Design a class Car having parameterized constructor that takes two arguments as an input i.e noOfGear and color and a printCarInfo method that prints the CarInfo i.e noOfGear and color.

Design another class RaceCar having parameterized constructor has an additional attribute maxSpeed and printRaceCarInfo method that prints the RaceCarInfo i.e noOfGear, color and maxSpeed.

Note: You have to create an object of class RaceCar and call the printRaceCarInfo method.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
5
red
1000
Sample Output 1:
noOfGear: 5
color: red
maxSpeed: 1000
Explanation of Sample output 1:
When we call the printInfo function, all the info related to the car will be printed the same as the above format.
