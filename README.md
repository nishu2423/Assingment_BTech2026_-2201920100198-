oops problem and solution (c++)

problem 1: (03-02-2025): Area of Rectangle

Problem statement
Design a class called Rectangle. It contains two data members as length(L) and breadth(B); and a member function getArea(). The member function computes the area of the given rectangle and returns it to the caller.

Note:

Area of a rectangle = length x breadth
Data Members:
1. length: Length of the rectangle
2. breadth: Breadth of the rectangle 
Member Functions:
1. getArea(): that calculates the area of the rectangle and returns the value.
Note:

You do not have to take input, just create the Class and set the name of the Data Members and function as given in the above discription.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
0 <= L, B <= 100
Sample Input 1:
4 20
Sample Output 1:
80
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
Length of the rectangle is 4 and breadth is 20. 
Hence the area of the rectangle is (length*breadth). 
So the answer is 4*20=80.
Sample Input 2:
2 10
Sample Output 2:
20
Explanation of Sample Input 2:
Length of the rectangle is 2 and breadth is 10. 
Hence the area of the rectangle is (length*breadth). 
So the answer is 2*10=20.



problem 2:(04-02-2025)  (Print Name and age)

Problem statement
Create a class named Person with a string variable 'name' and an integer variable 'age,' such that these variables are not accessible outside the class and implement a way to initialize the variables and print the variables.

Functions: 1.setValue- that sets the variables value. 2.getValue- that prints the variables value.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
Afzal
67
Sample Output 1:
The name of the person is Afzal and the age is 67.
Sample Input 2:
Ali
30
Sample Output 2:
The name of the person is Ali and the age is 30.
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
The input name is Ali and the input age is 30 which is printed in the specified format.
